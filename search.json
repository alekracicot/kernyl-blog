A seat on a Tuesday morning flight in November costs a fraction of the same seat on a Friday evening in December. Hotels, electricity markets, and concert tickets all follow similar patterns.\nWhat is new is the scale and sophistication. With modern data infrastructure, even small e-commerce shops can implement pricing strategies that used to require teams of revenue analysts.\n\n“The right price is whatever someone is willing to pay” is a common oversimplification. In practice, dynamic pricing tries to find the price that maximizes a specific objective — revenue, profit, or market share."

An airline might optimize for total revenue across all seats. A ride-sharing platform might optimize for market balance — enough drivers on the road to keep wait times low."
