*Welcome to the exciting world of revenue management and dynamic pricing.*

Whether you're an executive with years of practical experience in the airline business, a data scientist looking at applying your skills in the field, or just dreaming of a career in revenue management, our blog is intended to be a place to deepen your understanding of the principles behind RM. Our domain knowledge comes from working for various airlines around the world, but the principles we talk about here extend to other industries that price perishable assets, such as hotels or vacation rentals, car rentals, or events etc.

## What to Expect

We have diverse interests and hope to write for an equally diverse audience. Some posts will be geared toward revenue managers, while others will be more technical in nature.

We’ll use categories to help you easily filter and find content that matches your interests. We’re currently building a pipeline of ideas around:

- Fundamentals of Revenue Management (a back-to-basics series)
- Experimentation in Airlines
- Paper Reviews and Discussions

The theme and structure of this blog were inspired by [Vineeth's Digital Garden](https://www.vineeth.io/garden).
